			<h1>Lab 14 - Debugging </h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>In my Lab 8, my output was all clumped together. What I wanted to do was add a space and a comma to the array output.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>When solving the first issue, I ran into some other problems. In my lab 8, I had named output for the add array as just results. 
                        So when I tried to do my output, it was not working. When I renamed the name to somehting more descriptive, I was not confused. 
                        I also added multiple ids to the output so it was a little more readable. When I added a .append to the function name and .join 
                        to add the space and comma, the result went well.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I think I have come a long way from Lab 8 and it was pretty interesting to see what I could work on now that I know a little bit 
                        more/ are comfortable experimenting more. Debugging or trying to do better was daunting before but now it's more of an excitable challenge </p>

                        <p class="bold">This is how the Lab 8 results used to look like:</p>

                        <p>This is how Lab 8 looks after debugging:</p>
                        <div class="debuggingBox">
                            <p id="smallFont">This is the normal array: <div id="output1"></div></p>
                            <p id="smallFont">This is the array when +3 is added: <div id="output2"></div></p>
                            <p id="smallFont">This is the array when -3 is added: <div id="output3"></div></p>
