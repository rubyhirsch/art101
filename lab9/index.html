			<h1>Lab 7: Function</h1>

				<div class="minor-section rSpecial" id="challenger">
						<h2>Challenge</h2>
						<p>To experiment with JQuery and learn some basics of what the library can do.</p>

				<div class="minor-section tSpecial" id="problemo">
						<h2>Problems</h2>
						<p>Originally, our button was not working so we debugged it using console.log(). We realized that we did not use the '#' sign in the parenthesis.</p>
				</div>
	
				<div class="minor-section rSpecial" id="reflecto">
						<h2>Reflection</h2>
						<p>After the lecture, I was shaky on JQuery and I definitely feel a lot more comfortable now. 
                            The concepts go by really quickly and I ended up feeling a little bit lost at times, but going over these concepts with Franchesca was very helpful.</p>

						<h2>Results/Script Output</h2>
                            <p>You can see the toggle in motion.</p>
