			<h1>Lab 15 - AJAX </h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge was to experiment with jQuery and AJAX. We used the Yes/No API on our page.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>This was quite challenging as online learning is a lot more difficult for me, so I felt like the lecture was not sticking. As well
                        We looked back at the core code on the lecture slides and that helped us quite a bit. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab was really difficult, we experimented a lot on how to use APIs. But there is a lot to learn and it's really cool tool. 
                        I felt like this lab let me dip my toes in it without being too overwhelmed.</p>
