						<h2>Challenge</h2>
						<p>The challenge of the lab is experimenting with anonymous functions and callbacks</p>
				</div>
	
				<div class="minor-section">
						<h2>Problems</h2>
						<p>I was having some issues with printing out my results to the console log. When I first printed it out, both the anonymous function and the defined function had the same output. I realized that was because i hadn't defined part of the code for the anpnymous function</p>
