			<h1>Lab 11 - Events & Forms </h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge for this lab is to create input fields and buttons with different functions based on what you put into an input field.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>A problem we had was an error with jQuery not working correctly, however, we found out it wasn't working because our internet connection was spotty</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I think this lab was quite easy considering the code was provided to us, however figuring out how to do Task X was quite tricky when jQuery wasn't working because of our internet conenction. We weren't sure if what we were doing was making the code not work, or if was an outside thing (which it was).</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results/Script Output</h2>
					<p>Here is the results of our script! The "Sort" button will sort what is inputed into alphabetical order, and the "Randomize" button will create an anagram of what's inputed into the field.</p>
					<div id="output"></div>
					<input  type="text" id="name" placeholder="Input your name"> 
					<input  type="text" id="color" placeholder="Input a color"> 
					<input  type="text" id="animal" placeholder="Input an animal"> <br>
	 <div id="buttons"> <button id="sort">Sort</button>
						<button id="anagram">Randomize</button>
