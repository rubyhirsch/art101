			<h1>Lab 7: Function</h1>

				<div class="minor-section">
						<h2>Challenge</h2>
						<p>To write a function that takes user input and manipulate a string.</p>
				</div>
	
				<div class="minor-section">
						<h2>Problems</h2>
						<p>It was pretty easy. We only had one problem, and that was writing console.log() instead of document.writeln() but when we changed that, everything worked.</p>
				</div>
	
				<div class="minor-section">
						<h2>Reflection</h2>
						<p>It was really simple, but maybe I just have a good partner :3. 
                            We didn't do task X because I am really busy this week and 
                            this was the best time for us to do the work. After today,
                            I can't meet up with Franchesca so it was better off that 
                            we worked today in person and have one point off</p>
