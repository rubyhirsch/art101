			<h2>About us...</h2>
			<p>Hello, my name is Ruby. I am typing while my partner Franchesca is driving.<br></p>
			<p>We are friends and roommates!<br></p>
			<p>We are both AGPM majors and junior transfers!<br></p>
			<p>As mentioned on Franchesca's page, we are working on compiling a banana pile in our room.<br></p>
			<p>So far, we have collected an accumalitve amount of 8 bananas, however, we recently split a banana so now we only have seven.<br></p>
			<p>We will continue our efforts in growing our pile of bananas with the help of our friends!<br></p>
			<p>We will be abusing the dining hall's rule that a person is allowed to take one fruit or dessert to go.<br></p>
			<p>...<br></p>
			<p>After recalculating, it appears we are missing a banana!<br></p>
			<p>We will now be undergoing investigation for this missing banana.<br></p>
