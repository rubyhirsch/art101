					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>To create a function that depends on conditionals</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>When we were refactoring the code, we had some initial problems with the output. Instead of outputting the house name according to the value of the modulo, 
                        it was outputting it as undefined. This was because in the modulo, we had defined the value of mod as just length % 4 so it didn't have the str attached to it. 
                        When we fixed that, it worked again. Also, when we were debugging, we put console.log("name is " + name) and it got a weird HTML output name instead of the user input
                        So we just put the value property to the end of name and when we ran it again, we got the user's string input there instead. 
                    </p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>It was very useful learning to refactor, this was a productive task and it was good exercise!</p>
