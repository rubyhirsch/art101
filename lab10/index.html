						<h2>Problems</h2>
						<p>At first, the "Say something" button was not working. It was just a simple mistake, as I had made the button in the html "make-convo" instead of "make-combo." When we first tried to do Task X, it was kind of difficult because I had thought all the edits were in Javascript. I was messing around in my Javascript file and nothing was working but then I remembered that at the very beginning of the class, Wes had talked about how all stylistic stuff would be in CSS. It took some messing around with but it was pretty cool to see it appear!</p>

						<h2>Reflection</h2>
						<p>I was worried that this lab would be pretty confusing but it turned out fine! I feel like I have a come pretty far from when I first started. </p>
