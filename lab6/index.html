			<h1>Lab 6 - Arrays & Objects</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge for this lab was to experience creating objects and arrays in JavaScript.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We had a problem printing out our objects with strings.</p>

					<p><span class="talk"> Originally, we uh, we had pluses to group them together, um and, in the console 
					log we recieved an error, an error, um, an error an error, uh, hey stop! 
					That's evil, *laughs*, "that evil?" I said "that's evil!", we recieved "an error, an error, an error" 
					Okay. *laughs* we can make this multiple paragraphs if you want. 
					*laughs*...</span></p>

					<p>We realized that we could not put pluses and instead changed it to commas. When we tried commas merging strings and objects and pressed return, it worked!</p>
					<p>We also had problems printing out the script output, specifically the objects. After having our code reviewed by our friend majoring in CS, 
						<span class="calvin">Calvin Li</span>, he spotted that the object we were writing to be called, was not the correct object name. As soon as we changed it to its proper name, it finally worked!</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Some of the debugging was a little challenging. However we had a lot of fun working together figuring it out and using silly british accents to direct eachother.</p>
			</div>

					<h2>Results/Script Output</h2>
